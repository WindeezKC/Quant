# Trade Engine Project
Simple little trade engine I had made as a proof of conecpt kind of thing. Looking for a Quant Job, again this is the reason behind this entire portfolio. 
It is made for automated trading using a combined strategy based on the RSI, Bollinger bands and Moving Averages. Using historical data, generates trade signals and executes trades and tracks account performance

# Requirements
Python 3.7+
Libraries: pandas, plotly, alpaca_trade_api (or another API of your choice)
You can install the required libraries using pip:
`pip install pandas plotly alpaca_trade_api`

# Configuration
Using the config.py file, change the API and Secret API key based on your Alpaca account and base url for fethcing stock data. It is currently left `https://paper-api.alpaca.markets`
You will see in this file where and what to change. 

# Strategy 
As stated the trading strategy is a more simple one using RSI, Bollinger bands, and Moving Averages. The Current parameters used are: 

* RSI Period: 14
* Bollinger Bands Period: 20
* Short Moving Average Window : 40
* Long Moving Average Window : 100
* RSI Overbought Threshold: 30
* RSI Oversold Threshold: 30
* Stop Loss: 5%
* Maximum Drawdown: 20%

# Combined Strategy
The Combined Strategy generates buy and sell signals based on these conditions I thought would work well
* Buy Signal : When RSI is below the oversold threshold and the short moving average is above the long moving threshold
* Sell Signal : When RSI is above the overbought threshold and the short moving average is below the long moving average
* Stop Loss: Sell if the price drops by more than the stop-loss implemented from the most recent buy

# Usage
To run the trade engine you should just have to run main.py
`python main.py`

# Example Usage
* Configure your API keys, ensuring `config.py` has the correct API keys and URL
* Run the trade engine by executing `main.py`
* Right now the period set is between '2024-05-01' and '2024-05-03' for AAPL.
* The stock ticker symbol can be changed. Within this day period though it made multiple trades at buying/selling 50 shares a piece depending on what the engine wanted it to do. This can be changed, but overall performed better in this window then just buying and holding 50 shares of AAPL over the course of those 3 days. 



# Code Overview
* `main.py` 
The main entry point of the project. It sets up the account, initializes the strategy, fetches historical data, and runs the trade engine

* `combined_strategy.py`
Contains the CombinedStrategy class, which generates trading signals based on RSI, Bollinger Bands, and Moving Averages.

* `engine.py`
Contains the TradeEngine class, which executes trades based on the signals generated by the strategy, tracks the number of shares held, and monitors account performance.

* `data.py`
Contains functions to fetch historical and real-time data using the configured API.

* `accout.py`
Defines the Account class, which tracks the account balance and positions.

* `order.py`
Defines the Order class, representing buy and sell orders.

* `config.py`

Holds the configuration for API keys and base URL. (This file should not be pushed to GitHub for security reasons.)
